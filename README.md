## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections


This is my final outcome of my second project for my Creative Coding class. 

The brief said that we needed to make a collection of randomized faces, and have at least two continuous variability, and one of discrete variability. Different elements of the face will have randomized values, making every face different.

My design is based off of high constrast photography, where the shadows become very dark and the highlights become very bright. It is a very dramatic feel, but thats exactly what I was going for. I used custom shapes to create the head shape and the shadows, and layered them on top of each other. I plugged maps into these shadows to make the random function change the shape and size of the shadows, and manipulate the "light source". The design is meant to have an uncomfortable feeling to it, and be eery and strange. I added to this by making a spot light, and only shining it in the middle. I then added in some transparent rectangles to create the illusion of depth, and making it look like the faces were behind eachother, watching you from afar. I also added in a random set of red eyes, that will show up rarely. This will add to the unsettling aura from the faces, and make it not seem real.
