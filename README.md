## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

I've got the majority of my code working, and I'm still working on the aesthetics of my design. The colour palette is a big part of how the design will turn out, and I really need to make sure it is perfect. I've gone through about three different iterations of it now, but I'm still not sold on the current one. 

The shape of the highlights and shadows are also not quite right to me, but I think I need to fix the colours for it to look better. 

The next stage for me is to keep tweaking the little highlights and shadows, making sure it is sitting how I want it to.
